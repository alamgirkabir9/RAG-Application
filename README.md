## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can customize the application by modifying these variables in `app.py`:

```python
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'                    # Temporary upload directory
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 500 * 1024 * 1024     # Max file size (500MB)
SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key-change-this'  # Flask secret key
```

### Security

- Change the `SECRET_KEY` in production
- Consider adding authentication for production use
- Implement rate limiting for public deployments

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main upload interface
- `POST /upload` - Handle file uploads
- `GET /progress/<upload_id>` - Get upload progress
- `GET /cleanup` - Manual cleanup of old files

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid file types
- Missing required fields
- HuggingFace API errors
- Network connectivity issues
- File size limitations

## Auto-Cleanup

The application automatically cleans up temporary files older than 1 hour. You can also trigger manual cleanup by visiting `/cleanup`.

## Development

To run in development mode:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application runs on `http://localhost:5000` with debug mode enabled.

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set `debug=False` in `app.py`
2. Change the `SECRET_KEY` to a secure random value
3. Configure a proper web server (e.g., nginx + gunicorn)
4. Set up proper file permissions
5. Consider implementing authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'huggingface_hub'"**
   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions to the uploads directory

3. **Upload fails with authentication error**
   - Verify your HuggingFace token is correct and has proper permissions

4. **File too large**
   - Check if your file exceeds the 500MB limit

### Logs

The application logs errors to the console. Check the terminal output for detailed error messages.
